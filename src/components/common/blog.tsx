            🎮 A New Era of Fantasy Cricket Begins!
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Forget the old-school fantasy cricket format where you need a full
            squad of 11 players. Welcome to the 4 Horsemen Cricket League! Here,
            you only need four fearless warriors to bring you glory. No more
            overthinking about all-rounders or benchwarmers—just four
            power-packed players ready for battle!
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mt-6 ">
            🤔 Why four, you ask? Because great things come in fours!
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
            <li>🐎 Four directions guide us.</li>
            <li>🌍 Four seasons complete a year.</li>
            <li>🚗 Four wheels take us places.</li>
            <li>
              ⚰️ Four people carry us (a bit dark, but hey, reality check!).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
            So why not four players to lead your fantasy squad to victory? The
            rule is simple—pick from the playing XI! No benchwarmers, no
            last-minute impact subs, just pure cricketing strategy. Your
            selection is not just about names; it&apos;s about predicting
            performance and choosing wisely!

            🚀 The 4 Horsemen Selection Strategy
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Fantasy cricket is usually built around four key roles—🏏️ Batsman,
            🏆 Bowler, 🥅 Wicketkeeper, and 🏃 All-rounder. But we found that
            60% of users picked the same combinations. So, we threw the rulebook
            out the window! No restrictions—just pure cricketing instinct.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 font-medium">
            Choose any four players from a massive pool of 30 cricketers per
            match:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
            <li>✅ 11 from Team A</li>
            <li>✅ 4 Impact Subs from Team A</li>
            <li>✅ 11 from Team B</li>
            <li>✅ 4 Impact Subs from Team B</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
            {`The only rule? Pick from the playing XI! 🚫 No benchwarmers, no risky gambles—just smart cricketing choices. The more your players are in action, the more points you rack up. So, choose wisely, because in this game, playtime = points! 🏆`}

            📊 Points System: More Than Just Runs & Wickets!
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The <strong>4 Horsemen Cricket League</strong> isn&apos;t just about
            picking big names—it&apos;s about strategy! That&apos;s why our
            points system is carefully balanced to reward batting, bowling, and
            fielding brilliance. Here&apos;s how your warriors will earn fantasy
            points:
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">
            🏏 Batters Love This One
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
            ✔ 1 Run = 1 Point
            <br />
            (A century = 100 points, just like in real life! Unless, of course,
            you&apos;re a Test batsman scoring at 1 run per 30 balls… no points
            for patience here!)
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">
            🎯 Bowlers, We Got You!
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
            ✔ 1 Wicket = 20 Points
            <br />
            (A five-wicket haul = 100 points, making it just as valuable as a
            batter&apos;s century! Now you don&apos;t have to feel bad for being
            a bowler in a batsman&apos;s world.)
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">
            🧤 Fielding Matters Too!
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
            ✔ Catches, Runouts, Stumpings = 5 Points Each
            <br />
            (Because great catches deserve more than just claps! If your player
            pulls off a one-handed stunner, you might as well celebrate like
            Jonty Rhodes.)
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">
            😴 No Play, No Points!
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
            ✔ If your player is in the playing XI but never gets to bat or bowl
            = 0 Points
            <br />
            (You thought picking a lower-order batter who might never bat was a{" "}
            <em>genius</em> move? Think again. No freeloaders in 4 Horsemen!)

            ⏳ The Mystery of Delayed Points: Explained!

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
            Ever wondered why your fantasy points aren&apos;t updating as fast
            as your heartbeat during a Super Over? Well, here&apos;s the
            truth—we do things old-school. Unlike those fancy, corporate fantasy
            apps with automated data feeds, we manually update player scores
            after every match.

              robots (yet). We track every player&apos;s performance manually,
              which means sometimes points take a little longer to reflect.
            </li>
            <li>
              🐞 Bugs? It Happens! Did something seem off? Points missing?
